# gsu_activity
gsu activity is the terms of reference for the hackathon that took place at my university.
in general, the idea of the application is that a student can enter the application through registration and watch the events that take place, sign up for them or buy tickets, sign up for some section and a calendar of events.

all I did was register, but I plan to complete it to the end
